# FavGradient
 FavGradient is a a sequential background color changing gradient website.
 It is a one page website that changes its background gradient sequentially on clicking on the previous and next button. This means on clicking the next button, the background gradient changes to the next gradient in the default colors list; the reverse happens on clicking the previous button.
 
# Challenge Instructions (Day 2)
Add the following features to the gradient site you built for day one’s task:

A beautiful page loader on a white background that shows on loading the page
A button to add more gradients to the default gradient list
Give your gradient website a good name e.g uigrids.

A button to view and copy the css for the gradient website.
A hamburger icon with this text beside it “View all gradients”

The button to add more gradients should open a modal box containing two input fields for the two color codes and a button to save them.
The button to view and copy the css should also open a modal box displaying the css of the gradient and a button to copy. Check https://uigradients.com.
The hamburger icon should open a scrollable white colored overlay containing the gradients as cards. Check https://uigradients.com for more information
